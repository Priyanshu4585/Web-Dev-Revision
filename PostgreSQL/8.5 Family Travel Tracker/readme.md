How It Works

Users can create personalized profiles with a custom color theme.
The app fetches and displays each userâ€™s visited countries from the PostgreSQL database.
Users can add new countries to their travel history by providing the country name, which is verified against a database of countries.
This app is designed for families or groups who want an easy and interactive way to document their travels and maintain a shared log of their adventures.
